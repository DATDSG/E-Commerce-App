## Introduction

This application demonstrates the core functionalities of a typical e-commerce app, such as product listing, product details, and cart management. The primary focus of the project was on implementing user-friendly features and adhering to best practices in code styling and architecture.

## Features

- **Product Listing:** Displays a list of products with key details (name, price, thumbnail).
- **Product Details:** Shows detailed information about a selected product, including its full description and images.
- **Shopping Cart:** Allows users to add and remove products from the cart, view the cart's contents, and see the total price of selected items.
- **Navigation:** Users can navigate between the product list, product details, and cart pages seamlessly.

## Technologies Used

- **React Native**: For building the mobile application.
- **State Management**: 
  - [Zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/).
- **Tailwind CSS (via NativeWind)**: For styling components with utility-first CSS classes.
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to the API.

## Installation and Setup

   ```
   https://s3-eu-west1.amazonaws.com/api.themeshplatform.com/products.json
   ```

## Project Structure

Here's a brief overview of the project's structure:

```

├── /assets              # Images and other static assets
├── /components          # Reusable components (e.g., ProductCard, Button)
├── /screens             # Screen components (ProductList, ProductDetails, Cart)
├── /store               # Zustand store and related files
├── /navigation          # Navigation configuration
├── App.js               # Main entry point of the application
└── tailwind.config.js   # Tailwind CSS configuration file
```

## State Management Justification

In this project, I chose to use **[Zustand]** for state management.

- **Zustand**: Zustand was chosen due to its simplicity and lightweight nature. It provides a straightforward way to manage global state without the boilerplate that often comes with Redux, making it ideal for smaller projects like this one.

## Usage

- **Product Listing:** Browse through a list of products. Click on a product to view more details.
- **Product Details:** See detailed information about a product. Add the product to your cart.
- **Shopping Cart:** View and manage the products in your cart. Remove items if necessary and view the total price.

## Future Improvements

- **Enhanced Filtering and Sorting:** Adding options to filter and sort products based on various criteria (e.g., price, popularity).
- **User Authentication:** Implementing user login and registration features.
- **Persisting Cart State:** Saving the cart state across sessions using local storage or a backend.
